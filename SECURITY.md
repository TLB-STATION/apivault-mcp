# Security Policy

At **ApiVault**, the security and privacy of developer credentials and API keys are our top priorities.

---

## Zero-Knowledge & Architecture Guarantees

- **No Secrets on Disk**: The standalone MCP server acts purely as an in-memory transport gateway and does not store database credentials, master encryption keys, or unsealed secrets on disk.
- **Masked Previews by Default**: The `list_keys` and `get_key` tools only expose masked string previews (e.g. `sk_live_••••1234`), protecting secrets from inadvertently leaking into LLM prompt contexts.
- **Scoped OAuth 2.1**: AI agents can only access tools corresponding to granted scopes. Raw secrets require explicit `keys:reveal` authorization.
- **Constant-Time Verification**: PKCE S256 verifications use constant-time cryptographic buffer comparisons (`crypto.timingSafeEqual`) to prevent side-channel timing attacks.
